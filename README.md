# HarderEnemiesmod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous 
## Requirements: [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core/releases).

(Additional enemy behaviour should be enabled - not tested without it) 

Harder Enemies modifies bunch of enemies with new abilities, prebuffs, AI actions and HP buffs. Changes can be disabled by enemy type and between buffs/abilities(including AI changes) and HP boosts.

Currently, most modifications have been made to bunch of demons, cultists and boss fights. Boss fights are supposed to be tough and require reloads, but regular unit buffs are more about finding a role for unit & activating existings abilities. 

I have made one playthrough with the mod, but made bunch of changes after it. With newest changes, only played to Midnight Fane.
